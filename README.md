# Maze Game Project

This repository contains the second part of the project, a GUI interface based on MVVM architecture for the maze game
  In this link [Maze_Game_Project
](https://github.com/OranBe/Maze_Game_Project) you can find the first part of the project which includes the algorithms, and client server side

The project deals with the creation of a computer game that creates mazes and solves them using different algorithms 

### The project consists of 3 main parts:
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Writing algorithms for creating mazes, and solving search problems, placing great emphasis on SOLID principles, and used polymorphism for flexibility, allowing different implementations of the problem
- **Client-Server Communication:** Development of a server for creating mazes, and a server for solving search problems. while using compressed data for effective communication
- **GUI Implementation:** Created a GUI using the MVVM architecture
